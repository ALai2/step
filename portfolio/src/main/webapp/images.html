        <h2>Why These Pictures?</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy photographing and keeping pictures of memorable moments. 
          I have pictures of the Taekwondo team that I am currently on 
          as well as moments that I have with my college friends. 
          The base of the photo with the Harry Potter references was taken by a good friend of mine, Andrea, who is an English major. 
          I took the dessert photo at a restaurant called Mango Mango that recently opened in Ithaca Collegetown. 
          I went there with another friend named Lily because we wanted to eat dessert 
          after watching the movie JoJo Rabbit at Cornell Cinema.
          The Minecraft photo was taken very recently, over Memorial weekend. 
          This was my first time playing Minecraft and I didn't know what to do, 
          so I texted Andrea for help because she knew how to play and she explained to me what I needed to do to get started. 
          Surprisingly, I haven't had my first death yet, although the first skeleton that I encountered almost accomplished that. 
          It was nice that I got to do something with Andrea even though we are both stuck at home 
          so I took a picture of the starter house to show her what I created using her advice.
          <br/><br/>
          Sometimes I do take pictures of stuff other than my life such as nature. 
          Examples are animals and beautiful landscapes such as Ithaca Falls and sunsets. 
          I screenshot interesting quotes that I read on Instagram and interesting posts that I read on Facebook.
